When deployed, this script injects a div at the top of your body with three buttons:

* _validate HTML_ & _validate CSS_:  When clicked they open a new tab that validates your HTML or CSS source code using w3.org validation tools. (this is for you, but also to help your coaches evaluate your assignment)
* _development strategy_: This opens to your `development-strategy.md` page so someone visiting your site can easily see your wireframe and how you planned your work.
